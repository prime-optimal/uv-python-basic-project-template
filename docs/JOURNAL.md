# Journal Format
This journal structure is originally by lmmx's giacometti repo: (https://github.com/lmmx/giacometti).

In a post-vibe coding world, traditional documentation is usually overrated at best and at worst, confusing to AI agents which hinders progress.  The journal format seems far more relevant and useful, as it can be challenging to remember where you left off when you're having to dig through scattered documentation from various agents.

In addition to this structure, which can accommodate lots of details, I've added CHANGELOG.md, which should be treated as a concise, summarized version of what is expanded upon in each journal entry.  
After filling out the journal entry for the day (or adding to  an existing one), an agent should update CHANGELOG.md with bullet points of what they did, as well as add a link to that day's journal entry if it doesn't exist already. 

This is the last step before committing. 

## Entry Structure

A journal entry is a markdown file in `docs/journal/` named `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`
with up to four sections (only _Current State_ is required):

1. **Current State** - What is working and implemented
1. **Stubbed** - What exists as placeholder implementations
1. **Missing** - Functionality that has no code yet
1. **Divergence** - README documents behaviour that doesn't exist in code

Notes on sections:

- Distinguish "stubbed" (code exists, returns error) from "missing" (no code)
- "Divergence" compares to documented claims, not aspirations

## Writing Style

Journal entries follow the project communication principles:

### What to state

- State what exists, not what should exist
- Avoid bare constative verbs (exists, is) - describe what the component does or how it's implemented instead
- No recommendations or suggestions
- No evaluation words (better, cleaner, should)
- Use factual present tense only

### Bullet structure

- One statement per bullet
- Each bullet describes a single component's state (a backend, a CLI command, a workflow)
- List related files inline with commas when they implement the same component
- Each bullet is self-contained - no pronouns (this/it), no dependency on other bullets to understand, includes enough context to verify the statement independently

### File references

- Point to specific files and functions
- File paths in parentheses after statements for verification
- Include line numbers after file paths when referencing specific code (file.rs:45-52)

## Example Do/Don't

- ✅ "Release command not exposed in CLI (main.rs only wraps git commands)"
- ❌ "We should expose the release command in the CLI"
- ❌ "The CLI needs better command structure"

## Example Entry: uv Backends

Filename: `docs/journal/2025-01-25-uv-backends.md`
```markdown
# 2025-01-25: UV Backends

## Current State
- Backend architecture established (git + uv)
- Shell backends functional (git/shell.rs, uv/shell.rs)

## Stubbed
- gitoxide git backend (backends/git/gitoxide.rs)
- rust-crate uv backend (backends/uv/rust_crate.rs)

## Missing
- Release command not exposed in CLI (main.rs only wraps git commands)

## Divergence
- README shows `gcmti release --bump minor` but CLI doesn't accept release subcommand
```

## Example Entry: Release CLI

Filename: `docs/journal/2025-01-28-release-cli.md`
```markdown
# 2025-01-28: Release CLI

## Current State
- main.rs implements release subcommand using clap derive
- CLI accepts --backend flag (shell, gitoxide, github-api) for git operations
- release subcommand calls git::release::run with selected backend (main.rs:45-52)

## Stubbed
- gitoxide git backend selected via CLI but returns "not yet implemented" (backends/git/gitoxide.rs)

## Missing
- CLI backend selection only applies to git operations, uv operations hardcoded to shell backend (main.rs:48)

## Divergence
- README shows GHA usage with `uses: lmmx/giacometti@v1` but no action.yml in repository
```
